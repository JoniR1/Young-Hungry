            <h3>Fun Fact: Mere Exposure Effect!</h3>
            <p>Repetition breeds familiarity, and familiarity breeds liking!
                Keep exposing your kids to new music, and watch their tastes 
                evolve.
            </p>
            <p>The more you're exposed to something, the more you tend 
                to like it! This principle, known as the Mere Exposure 
                Effect, explains why your kids start to like a song they 
                once hated after hearing it a few times. Keep playing that 
                good music--eventually, they'll come around!
